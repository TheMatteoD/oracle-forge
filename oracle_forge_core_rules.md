# Oracle Forge Core Rules

Oracle Forge is a solo-first, narrative-driven TTRPG experience where the rules are designed to guide rather than constrain. This rulebook outlines a flexible but structured core that encourages creativity, improvisation, and emergent storytelling.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy of Play

Oracle Forge is not about strict mechanics or predetermined builds. Instead, it gives you a strong narrative and mechanical foundation, then encourages you to bend and build upon it. Rules exist to support your story—not to override it.

- You can start wherever you want.
- You can invent your own race, class, skills, traits.
- The Oracle is your ultimate guide—ask it when you’re unsure.

## 🎲 Starting the Game

All players begin at **Level 0**. You may start in a dungeon, town, wilderness, or anywhere else fitting your story.

**At Level 0:**
- All BAM (Brawn, Agility, Mind) scores start at 0.
- Choose ONE starting item:
  - A basic air spell
  - A dagger
  - A shortbow with 15 arrows
- Starting Inventory:
  - 12 Health
  - 12 Stamina
  - 10 Encumbrance
  - 1 Ration
  - 5 Gold
- Declare your **Race** (can be anything).

### 🔑 The First Trial
To reach Level 1, you must complete a personal "First Trial":
- This could be a dungeon, a rescue, a contract, or any significant task.
- Upon completion:
  - Gain 1 point to assign to BAM
  - Declare your **Class**

## 🧬 Attributes

### 🪖 Core Stats
- **Health:** Your life total. Reaching 0 = unconscious or death (GM's discretion).

- **Encumbrance:** Maximum weight/carrying capacity.

### ⚔️ BAM Scores (Brawn, Agility, Mind)
- Used for attacks, challenges, and saving throws.
- Attack types:
  - **Brawn:** Melee, physical feats
  - **Agility:** Ranged, finesse weapons
  - **Mind:** Magic, psychic abilities

> You may reinterpret what BAM applies based on your weapon or approach. Group consensus decides.

### 💭 Morality
- Starts at 0
- Can increase or decrease based on actions
- Is **public knowledge**—NPCs and the world respond accordingly
- High morality = better prices, trust

**Skill Advancement:**
- Use a skill **5 times** → Skill Level 1

## 🧱 Actions & Stamina

Stamina acts as a time and energy resource. It fuels exploration, combat, and crafting.

| Action                 | Stamina Cost |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Travel 1 Hex           | 1            |
| Combat Encounter       | 2            |
| Foraging               | 1            |
| Crafting               | 1            |
| Cooking                | 1            |
| Casting a Spell        | 1 per spell  |
| Skill Use (general)    | 1            |

**Resting:**
- With a ration: Recover full stamina
- Without ration:
  - Reduced stamina recovery
  - Lose 3 health after 2nd consecutive rationless rest (cumulative effect)

---

## ⚔️ Combat

Combat follows an OSR-inspired, dice-heavy system with flexible interpretation.

**Attack Flow:**
1. Describe your action
2. Choose BAM stat to apply
3. Roll d20 + applicable BAM modifiers
4. Spend 1 stamina for combat boost:
   - +1 to damage OR +1 to hit (whichever is not chosen gets -1)
5. Narration and Oracle rulings influence outcomes (e.g., advantage for clever tactics)

**Leveling BAM:**
- Every 5 levels in BAM = +1 to attacks using that stat

**Saving Throws:**
- Each BAM serves as its own saving throw stat

---

## 📈 Leveling Up

### Gaining Levels:
- After your First Trial, your story dictates how you gain levels (GM/Oracle discretion, or XP/milestone system).

### At Every 5 Levels:
- Add **5 points** distributed among Health, Stamina, or Encumbrance

---

## 🧙‍♀️ Spells & Magic

- Mind determines how many spells you can retain.
- Magic users may discover **"Inversion" rules**—ways to reverse spells.
- Spells cost 1 stamina to cast.

> Spell discovery and definition is player-driven. Found a scroll? You decide what the spell does (with group or Oracle approval).

---

## 🌀 Final Notes
- All definitions are up for interpretation.
- Let group consensus and the Oracle decide disputes.
- Feel free to invent traits, skills, races, and rules.

**Oracle Forge** rewards creativity. The rules are your toolkit—forge your own legend.
