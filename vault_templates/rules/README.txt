This directory is for storing game rules, house rules, and rule-related documentation in Markdown format.

Supported file types:
- .md - Markdown files (recommended)
- .txt - Plain text files

Naming convention:
- Use descriptive names: "combat_rules.md", "magic_system.md"

- Group related rules: "character_creation_rules.md"

Rule files should:
- Be well-organized with clear headings
- Include examples where helpful
- Reference page numbers from source books when applicable
- Be kept up to date with any rule changes

The system will automatically index and search rule files from this directory.
