# Oracle Forge

Oracle Forge is an offline, locally-hosted AI-powered role-playing game. 

### Development Status

> **Note:** This project is currently in a rapid prototyping phase.
>
> This project has been a fun test of the bounds of vibe-coding. While it was able to assist in creating a working prototype, I found the resulting codebase to be a mess. Moving forward without vibe-coding, the current goal for this project is to establish a clear design pattern for features. In the process, cleaning up the existing codebase and creating a solid framework for the app to build on.
